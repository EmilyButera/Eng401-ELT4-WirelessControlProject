# Wireless Control Project - Server Setup

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

The DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error occurs because the Web Bluetooth API requires the HTML file to be served through a web server (localhost or HTTPS), not opened directly as a file.

### Option 1: Use the Automated Server (Recommended)

**For Windows:**
1. Double-click `start_server.bat`
2. The browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
3. Keep the terminal window open while using the app

**For Manual Start:**
```bash
python server.py
```

### Option 2: Alternative Server Methods

**Using Python (if you have it installed):**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

**Using Node.js (if you have it installed):**
```bash
# Install a simple server
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server -p 8000

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

**Using VS Code Live Server Extension:**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 3: Direct File Access (Limited functionality)

If you must open the file directly:
1. Open Chrome or Edge
2. Go to `chrome://flags/` or `edge://flags/`
3. Search for "Insecure origins treated as secure"
4. Add `file://` to the list
5. Restart browser
6. Open the HTML file directly

**Note:** This method may have limited Bluetooth functionality.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Port 8000 already in use:**
   - Try a different port: `python server.py --port 8001`
   - Or kill the existing process

2. **Python not found:**
   - Install Python from https://python.org
   - Make sure Python is added to PATH

3. **Browser doesn't support Web Bluetooth:**
   - Use Chrome or Edge (latest versions)
   - Safari and Firefox don't support Web Bluetooth

4. **Bluetooth device not found:**
   - Make sure your device is in pairing mode
   - Check if your device uses the correct Bluetooth service UUID
   - Try the "Connect via Serial" option for USB connections

## üîê Security Notes

- The server only runs locally on your machine
- No external network access is required
- All data stays on your local network
- The server automatically opens the correct URL

## üìû Need Help?
